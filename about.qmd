I graduated from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech, VT) with dual degrees in Chemistry and Public Health. During my undergraduate studies in Blacksburg, Virginia, I explored various research areas, enriching my multidisciplinary background. In chemistry, I conducted two projects focused on battery cell development. In biology, I worked on rotavirus vaccine development, using gnotobiotic pig models to study human enteric virus infections and diseases.

As my career focus has shifted towards infectious disease research, I am eager to further immerse myself in public health and epidemiology. I have gained significant experience in modeling respiratory transmissible diseases, using COVID-19 as a case study. Leveraging mobility data from mobile phones, I developed simulations to study disease transmission dynamics in Virginia, examining how different outbreak origins and seasonal factors influence spread patterns. Looking ahead, my goal over the next 5-10 years is to delve deeper into research on infectious disease transmission, contributing to the advancement of public health interventions.
