Image created by Hanzla Nawaz\n\n\n\nBackground\n\n\nMonkeypox, a viral disease caused by an orthopoxvirus, triggered a global outbreak in May 2022, originating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. A newly identified strain, Clade Ib, was primarily responsible for this outbreak, spreading to regions and countries previously unaffected by the disease2. Understanding this transmission pattern and identifying potential risk factors is critical to assessing future transmission risks. This leads to my research question for this analysis:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Question\nAre there patterns in the demographic and travel history data that could inform public health responses to Monkeypox outbreaks?\n\n\nData Description\nThe data contains detailed information about the Monkeypox cases during the 2022 outbreak, including demographic data, clinical information, etc. For more information, see the data dictionary.\n\n\nCleaning Process\nIn this section, I have conducted some data cleaning and also showed 5 different functions from dplyr or tidyr package. 1. dplyr::mutate; 2.  dplyr::case_when; 3. dplyr::filter; 4. dplyr::count; 5. tidyr::separate_rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn this analysis page, all the code chuncks have been toggled.

A few things is good to notice:\n\n\n1. the outbreak began with an initial case confirmed on May 6, followed by a significant upward trend starting around May 16. Given monkeypox’s estimated incubation period of approximately 8.2 days3, the estimated incubation period of 10 days from the epidemic curve align with the scientific evidence of monkeypox;\n2. Several distinct peaks are visible toward the end of May, followed by a sharp decline in early June. This pattern indicates possible phases of intensified transmission or surges in case identifying, which could be associated with international travel and mobility during the outbreak period. The rapid decrease in cases in early June may suggest that public health interventions, likely implemented at the end of May, were effective in curtailing the outbreak. The overall left-skewed shape of the epidemic curve supports this, indicating a swift and effective response that helped to control the spread and bring the outbreak to an end by early June.\n\n\n\nHospitalization vs. Non-Hospitalization by Age Group (Bar Plot with Facets)\n\n\nCode\n# 3.

Higher hospitalization rates are observed among certain age groups, particularly in the “40-49” and “50-59” age groups, suggesting these demographics may face higher risks of severe outcomes.

The epidemic curve indicates a sharp rise in cases around mid-May, with multiple peaks and a rapid decline in early June, suggesting that interventions implemented at the end of May were effective in controlling the outbreak. The geographical distribution of cases highlights significant transmission in non-endemic regions, particularly in North America and Europe, underscoring the role of international travel in disease spread. Hospitalization rates varied significantly across age groups, with older populations facing a higher risk of severe outcomes, as confirmed by a chi-square test (p-value = 0.002027). This finding emphasizes the need for targeted interventions to protect vulnerable age groups. Overall, the analysis provides critical insights for public health planning, reinforcing the importance of timely interventions, monitoring travel-associated transmission, and allocating healthcare resources for at-risk populations.\n\n\nFunction Used in This Analysis\nAs I mentioned above, here are a few functions related to dplyr or tidyr:\n\n\n\ndplyr::mutate\ndplyr::case_when\ndplyr::filter\ndplyr::count\ntidyr::separate_rows\n\n\nA few functions for ggplot2:\n\n\nggplot2::geom_sf\nggplot2::geom_line\nggplot2::geom_col\nggplot2::geom_tile\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n1.
