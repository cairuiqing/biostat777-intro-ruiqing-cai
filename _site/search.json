    "text": "I graduated from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech, VT) with dual degrees in Chemistry and Public Health. During my undergraduate studies in Blacksburg, Virginia, I explored various research areas, enriching my multidisciplinary background. In chemistry, I conducted two projects focused on battery cell development. In biology, I worked on rotavirus vaccine development, using gnotobiotic pig models to study human enteric virus infections and diseases.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs my career focus has shifted towards infectious disease research, I am eager to further immerse myself in public health and epidemiology. I have gained significant experience in modeling respiratory transmissible diseases, using COVID-19 as a case study. Leveraging mobility data from mobile phones, I developed simulations to study disease transmission dynamics in Virginia, examining how different outbreak origins and seasonal factors influence spread patterns. Looking ahead, my goal over the next 5-10 years is to delve deeper into research on infectious disease transmission, contributing to the advancement of public health interventions.\n\n\nEducation\nJohns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health | MHS in Epidemiology; Concentrate on Infectious Disease | Current\nVirginia Polytechnic Institute and State University | B.S. in Public Health | B.A. in Chemistry | Graduated May 2023\n\n\n\nResearch Experience\nCenter for Evidence-Based and Translational Medicine, Wuhan University | Research Assistant | Dr. Xiantao Zeng’s Lab | Survival Analysis on Oncology | June 2024 - Present\nJohns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health | Graduate Research Assistant | Dr. Amy Wesolowski’s Team & Infectious Disease Dynamics JHBSPH | Malaria Transmission Dynamic Modeling | November 2023 - Present\nVirginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine, Virginia Tech | Undergraduate Research Assistant | Dr. Nick Ruktanonchai’s Team | Infectious Diseases (Respirotory Diseases) Transmission Model in Virginia | August 2022 - August 2023\nVirginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine, Virginia Tech | Undergraduate Research Assistant | Dr. Lijuan Yuan’s Lab | Vaccine Development for Rotavirus by Using Gnotobiotic Pig Models | February 2022 - December 2022\nVirginia Tech College of Science | Undergraduate Research Assistant | Dr. Feng Lin’s Lab | Lithium Battery Cell Development | December 2021 - December 2022\nHubei Topgene Biotechnology Co., Ltd | Research Intern | Topgenebio | Medicine toxicology and the pharmacokinetics of Antibiotics by Using Rhesus Macaque Models | November 2020 - March 2021\n\n\n\nActivities\nJohns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health | Teaching Assistant | Epidemiologic Method 2 | October 2024 - Present\nJohns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health | Teaching Assistant | Epidemiologic Inference in Outbreak Investigations course | August 2024 - October 2024\nVirginia Polytechnic Institute and State University | Peer Tutor | Student Success Center | August 2022 - May 2023\nAmerican Red Cross | Volunteer | January 2022 - January 2023\n\n\n\nMore and More - “purr-ent”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYo-Yo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoxi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMorgan"

Image created by Hanzla Nawaz\n\n\n\nBackground\n\n\nMonkeypox, a viral disease caused by an orthopoxvirus, triggered a global outbreak in May 2022, originating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. A newly identified strain, Clade Ib, was primarily responsible for this outbreak, spreading to regions and countries previously unaffected by the disease (https://www.who.int/emergencies/situations/mpox-outbreak). Understanding this transmission pattern and identifying potential risk factors is critical to assessing future transmission risks. This leads to my research question for this analysis:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Question\nAre there patterns in the demographic and travel history data that could inform public health responses to Monkeypox outbreaks?\n\n\nData Description\nThe data contains detailed information about the Monkeypox cases during the 2022 outbreak, including demographic data, clinical information, etc. For more information, see the data dictionary.\n\n\nCleaning Process\nIn this section, I have conducted some data cleaning and also showed 5 different functions from dplyr or tidyr package. 1. dplyr::mutate; 2. dplyr::case_when; 3. dplyr::filter; 4. dplyr::count; 5. tidyr::separate_rows\n\n\nCode\n# 1.
