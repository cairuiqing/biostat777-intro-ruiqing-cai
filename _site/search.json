    "text": "I graduated from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech, VT) with dual degrees in Chemistry and Public Health. During my undergraduate studies in Blacksburg, Virginia, I explored various research areas, enriching my multidisciplinary background. In chemistry, I conducted two projects focused on battery cell development. In biology, I worked on rotavirus vaccine development, using gnotobiotic pig models to study human enteric virus infections and diseases.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs my career focus has shifted towards infectious disease research, I am eager to further immerse myself in public health and epidemiology. I have gained significant experience in modeling respiratory transmissible diseases, using COVID-19 as a case study. Leveraging mobility data from mobile phones, I developed simulations to study disease transmission dynamics in Virginia, examining how different outbreak origins and seasonal factors influence spread patterns. Looking ahead, my goal over the next 5-10 years is to delve deeper into research on infectious disease transmission, contributing to the advancement of public health interventions.\n\n\nEducation\nJohns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health | MHS in Epidemiology; Concentrate on Infectious Disease | Current\nVirginia Polytechnic Institute and State University | B.S. in Public Health | B.A. in Chemistry | Graduated May 2023\n\n\n\nResearch Experience\nCenter for Evidence-Based and Translational Medicine, Wuhan University | Research Assistant | Dr. Xiantao Zeng’s Lab | Survival Analysis on Oncology | June 2024 - Present\nJohns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health | Graduate Research Assistant | Dr. Amy Wesolowski’s Team & Infectious Disease Dynamics JHBSPH | Malaria Transmission Dynamic Modeling | November 2023 - Present\nVirginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine, Virginia Tech | Undergraduate Research Assistant | Dr. Nick Ruktanonchai’s Team | Infectious Diseases (Respirotory Diseases) Transmission Model in Virginia | August 2022 - August 2023\nVirginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine, Virginia Tech | Undergraduate Research Assistant | Dr. Lijuan Yuan’s Lab | Vaccine Development for Rotavirus by Using Gnotobiotic Pig Models | February 2022 - December 2022\nVirginia Tech College of Science | Undergraduate Research Assistant | Dr. Feng Lin’s Lab | Lithium Battery Cell Development | December 2021 - December 2022\nHubei Topgene Biotechnology Co., Ltd | Research Intern | Topgenebio | Medicine toxicology and the pharmacokinetics of Antibiotics by Using Rhesus Macaque Models | November 2020 - March 2021\n\n\n\nActivities\nJohns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health | Teaching Assistant | Epidemiologic Method 2 | October 2024 - Present\nJohns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health | Teaching Assistant | Epidemiologic Inference in Outbreak Investigations course | August 2024 - October 2024\nVirginia Polytechnic Institute and State University | Peer Tutor | Student Success Center | August 2022 - May 2023\nAmerican Red Cross | Volunteer | January 2022 - January 2023\n\n\n\nMore and More - “purr-ent”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYo-Yo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoxi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMorgan"
